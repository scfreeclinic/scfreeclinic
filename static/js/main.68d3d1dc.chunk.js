In July, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found that the there had been an estimated 153 deaths in the unhoused populations of San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, D.C., Seattle, and Phoenix, which is over twenty more deaths than the current administration\u2019s homelessness czar had predicted for the entire country\u2019s unhoused population. Because there aren\u2019t any solid numbers on how the unhoused population of the US has been affected by the virus, it\u2019s that much more difficult to know the extent of its damage. According to Modern Healthcare, the two major problems in handling the virus\u2019 effect on the unhoused population were, \u201ca lack of readiness to work across departments dealing with both housing and health and insufficient data and testing to know who was getting sick and where.\u201d"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"On top of the apparent lack of concern for keeping track of the number of infections and deaths from a global pandemic, there seemed to be a rather disordered approach to giving aid to unhoused people. According to the Howard Center, some cities, such as San Diego and Colorado Springs, constructed emergency isolation centers, emergency homeless shelters, and meal distribution centers. Other cities were not as resourceful. In Sangar, California, the city manager opposed accepting trailers that would give accommodations to  unhoused people that had been infected. In Daytona Beach, Florida, efforts to transform an unused building into permanent housing failed despite having county support and funding, and no reason was given as to why the plans fell through."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"There has also been a lack of direction for the funds that cities were given to aid to their unhoused communities. According to the Howard Center, four months after the CARES act was passed, cities and counties had only spent one third of the funds they had been allocated, most of them waiting for federal direction on how to spend it. Because of this, people in need of assistance aren\u2019t getting the kind of help they need despite the fact that there are funds to do so. Many homelessness professionals are also concerned that, when the money is used, it will be directed towards keeping people in their homes, rather than going towards helping those already unhoused. Because of this, many communities have been and continue to take it upon themselves to provide help to those in need. With homeless shelters and other resources commonly available for unhoused people being closed due to the risk from COVID, many unhoused communities heavily rely on these community-funded resource handouts."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Whether it be not traveling back home or not being able to see at-risk loved ones, COVID-19 has changed the way we live. It\u2019s a difficult and frustrating way to live, and it\u2019s had an especially negative effect on the unhoused populations of the US. Being one of the most at-risk and neglected populations, they are often in need of assistance from other entities besides the government.
