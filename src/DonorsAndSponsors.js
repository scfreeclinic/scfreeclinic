                            Bombas was founded on the belief that everyone 
                            deserves access to clean clothes, no matter their circumstance. 
                            They have graciously sent us over 1000 pairs of socks so that 
                            we can distribute to those experiencing houselessness in the Santa 
                            Cruz community!

                            <p>Did you know that by 2050, there will be more plastic in our ocean 
                                than fish? This statistic is what led the founders of Pathwater to 
                                create a brand that aims to end the use of single-use plastic bottles. 
                                Itâ€™s also what led them to expand their mission by partnering with 
                                organizations such as the Santa Cruz Free Clinic! We would like to extend 
                                 gratitude to them for sending us over 160 reusable bottles to distribute 
                                 amongst those experiencing houselessness in the Santa Cruz community! </p>
