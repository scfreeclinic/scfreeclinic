                  Santa Cruz Free Clinic is working to provide assistance to
                  those members of our community who are experiencing
                  houselessness during this time. To do this we have created
                  COVID-19 kits to distribute that are filled with health and
                  hygiene items like toothbrushes and feminine care products
                  among other items. We have also included personal protective
                  equipment or PPE like masks and hand sanitizer in our kits to
                  help protect the recipients from the spread of COVID-19. If
                  you would like to help aid our efforts in providing these kits
                  to our community, donations can be made through here:
